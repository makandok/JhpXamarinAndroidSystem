This project is about creating an app for rendering sensitive health information and deliberately deviates from approaches such as ODK.
Tools: C#, Visual studio, Xamarin and Android Studio
Backend: Cloud Store
Approach:
Forms are defined in Excel, convereed to a JSON field list and adde used to prepare a secondary list of fields and matching data types.
Uses page by page navigation for data entry.
Creatings XML and AXML uis based on forms and this makes it easy to further customise the app.
